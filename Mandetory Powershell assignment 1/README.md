Script1 is assignment 1 and 2

Script2 is assignment 3 and 4

Script5 is assignment 5

Assignment 5 is solved by using the random generator to create a random number between 1 and 19. This is used to 
encrypt instead of just adding the number 1. After encrypting, it gives the key for decrypting and this is typed in and 
substracted to decrypt the string.
